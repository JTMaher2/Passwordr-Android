# Passwordr-Android
A cloud-based password manager for Android

Passwordr is a free, cloud-based, password manager app for web and Android. It uses the Java cryptography library to encrypt all data before it gets sent to Cloud Firestore (https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/). Sign-in is handled with Firebase Authentication (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/). Currently, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub sign-ins are supported.
While I believe Passwordr is secure, I take no liability for damage to your online identity, such as hacked accounts, if you use this service. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
